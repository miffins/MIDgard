# MIDgard
Mostly just a points server.

My attempt to learn how to website. Decided to use Flask because Django looks like massive overkill, and I'm not touching PHP with a 12 foot pole, remotely controlled by a robot arm.

Should eventually have a REST API, because all the cool kids are doing it. This ought to allow MID (as in , the MID that lives on Node-RED on a RPi2 downstairs) to mess with it.
